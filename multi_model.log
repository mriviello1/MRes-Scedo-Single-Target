              will treat this residue as a rigid body.
              To use real parameters, add the residue type to ${LIB}/restyp.lib,
              its topology to ${LIB}/top_*.lib, and suitable forcefield
              parameters to ${LIB}/par.lib.

  Alignment residue type   11 (M, MET) does not match pdb
  residue type    1 (A, ALA),
  for align code 3u2o (atom file 3u2o), pdb residue number "31", chain "A"

  Please check your alignment file header to be sure you correctly specified
  the starting and ending residue numbers and chains. The alignment sequence
  must match that from the atom file exactly.

  Another possibility is that some residues in the atom file are missing,
  perhaps because they could not be resolved experimentally. (Note that Modeller
  reads only the ATOM and HETATM records in PDB, NOT the SEQRES records.)
  In this case, simply replace the section of your alignment corresponding
  to these missing residues with gaps.
